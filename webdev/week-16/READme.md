- http server has route, and when ever a client sent a request to server, server sent response back to the client, and this is not call persistent connection,

- The websocket server provides persistance connection, once connection has been made, it stage there, we can send multiple requeste and again and again, we may or may not get reponse, but client can send request again and again.

- websocket is a full-duplex server, so client can send multiple messages to server and server also can send multiple replies to the client

this is pure websocket with node...
